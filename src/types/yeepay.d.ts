// This file can be used to declare types for JavaScript modules that lack
// their own type definitions or @types packages.

// Keep this declaration if 'urlsafe-base64' is used and has no @types package.
declare module 'urlsafe-base64';

// Removed declarations for 'axios', 'dotenv', '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk',
// 'yop-nodejs-sdk/*', and 'md5' as they are either covered by @types packages,
// are likely TS-native, or are incorrect/unused dependencies.

// Add project-specific global type declarations or augmentations here if needed.
